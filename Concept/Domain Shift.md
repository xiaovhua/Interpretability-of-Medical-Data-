# Domain Shift

Domain Shift (DS) means the distributions of source domain (e.g. training data) and target domain (e.g. test data or real world data) are different. It is very common in medical problems, various sequences, modalities and sites will lead to DS, and potential factors such as scanners, field-of view, spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and digital processing software will also result in the distribution gaps.

To overcome DS, one popular method is to extract domain-invariant representations, which can work well in both source domain and target domain.
