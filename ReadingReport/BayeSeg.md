### Motivation
[Domain Shift](https://github.com/xiaovhua/Interpretability-of-Medical-Data-/blob/main/Concept/Domain%20Shift.md) is common in medical problems. Extracting domain-invariant features is one of the most popular methods for the issue, but the **_interpretability of domain-invariant features_** remains a challenge. To this end, the authors
